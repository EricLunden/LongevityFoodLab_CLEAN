# App Store Language Guidelines for Nutrition Summaries

## CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS

This app is NOT a medical app. All language must remain educational and descriptive.

### Allowed Phrasing:
- "supports normal function"
- "associated with"
- "contains nutrients linked to"
- "plays a role in"
- "commonly studied in relation to"
- "part of dietary patterns researched for"

### Prohibited Phrasing:
- "improves", "treats", "prevents", "reduces disease risk"
- "enhances mitochondrial ATP production"
- "suppresses cytokines"
- "improves circulation"
- "neuroprotection"
- "anti-inflammatory effects" (causal)
- "activates pathways"
- "boosts production"
- "reduces inflammation"
- "improves sleep"
- "strengthens immune system"

### Key Principles:
1. Do NOT describe biological mechanisms as outcomes
2. Frame benefits as nutrient presence, not functional performance
3. Do NOT imply a food is a therapeutic intervention
4. Citations are supporting context, not evidence of treatment
5. Use neutral, factual, non-promissory language
